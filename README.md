# ML-Suicide-detection-using-Reddit-data
using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) tools to detect suicidal thoughts in reddit data.

NLP Techniques used for feature extraction:
TF-IDF with 1-gram, 2-gram
BOW
VADER Sentiment Analysis from NLTK

Models used for training:
SVM with linear kernel
Random Forest
Ensemble Learning ( logisitic regression, Random Forest, SVM with linear kernel)
Bagging with decisiion trees

Only 33% of the data were used for the training and testing process since learning using all the data exceeded the laptop's processing capabilities and also cloud computing on colab or kaggle

Highest accuracy was 93% with the Ensemble Model
